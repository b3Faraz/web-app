Spring Boot is a framework designed to simplify the development of Java-based web applications by providing a convention-over-configuration approach. It enables developers to build production-ready applications with minimal setup and boilerplate code.

A basic Spring Boot application consists of the following key components:

Spring Boot Starter: A set of pre-configured dependencies for quick setup.
Spring Boot Auto-Configuration: Automatically configures beans and dependencies based on the classpath.
Embedded Server: Comes with an embedded Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow server for running the application without external configuration.
Spring Boot CLI (Optional): Allows running and testing applications quickly without writing extensive configuration files.
Key Features of Spring Boot:
‚úîÔ∏è Standalone Applications ‚Äì No need for complex XML configurations.
‚úîÔ∏è Embedded Servers ‚Äì Eliminates the need for external web servers like Tomcat.
‚úîÔ∏è Microservices Support ‚Äì Ideal for building scalable microservices.
‚úîÔ∏è Production-Ready Features ‚Äì Includes health checks, metrics, and logging via Spring Actuator.

Steps to Create a Basic Spring Boot App
1Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up a Spring Boot Project ‚Äì Use Spring Initializr to generate a project with required dependencies.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Add a Main Class ‚Äì The @SpringBootApplication annotation initializes the application.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Define REST Controllers ‚Äì Use @RestController to expose RESTful endpoints.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Application ‚Äì Execute mvn spring-boot:run or run the main method.

By following these steps, you can quickly set up a Spring Boot application and start developing REST APIs, web applications, or microservices efficiently. üöÄ
